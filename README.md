# Analyze A/B Test Results
This project was achieved in Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
## Purpose
The objective of this project was to analyze a case study using the learnt techniques for practical statistics, A/B testing and regression models.
Also to start optimizing my GitHub profile and improve README files.
## Case study
An e-commerce company is looking to implement a new page, they have gathered data for the conversion for 2 groups of users, testing the old page (the control user group) and the new page (the treatment user group) by A/B testing.
## Project's main aspects
- Part I: Probability
- Part II: A/B Test
- Part III: Regression
- Conclusions
### Added measures
I practiced timestamp regression through weekdays and weekends categories (welcome to notedown improvements here) as a further analysis scope.
### Conclusions
We fail to reject the null hypothesis as there is no significant evidence of the new page converting better than the old page.
## Structure of the reporistory
You will find the html and ipynb formats of the project done (will post a summary report notebook later on), and the supporting files used.
