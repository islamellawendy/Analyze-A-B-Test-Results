# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
Third project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree. I have followed the project's step by step analysis of the webpage case study.
I stated the null and alternative hypothses of my studies in every case (for the A/B testing and the logistic regression model)
#### The repo has a notebook about timestamp and the main notebook contains all the resources that I used to enhance my project.
